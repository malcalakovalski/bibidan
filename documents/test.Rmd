## [R Markdown]{.ul}

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r myplot, echo=FALSE }
library('tidyverse')
p <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point()
p
```

The sum of 2 + 2 is 

```{r}
2 + 2
```
